# Bevy Shader Playground

This is a playground to explore and mess with shaders using [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy).

## Explore Bevy Game of Life Shader

A mini-tutorial series I wrote that can be found [here](https://lecoqjacob.github.io/bevy-gol-explore-part-1), where I explore how bevy setups up
compute shaders using their game of life example. I further expand on the example by adding a few new featues:

- Camera Controller
- Wrapping Simulation
- Drawing on the simulation
- Storage / Uniform Buffers
- Heatmap for visual effects :D
- Seperate color pipeline to distinquish between compute shaders
